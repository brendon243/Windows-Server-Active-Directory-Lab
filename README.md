# Windows Server Active Directory Lab

## About The Project

This project demonstrates the deployment and configuration of a Windows Server Active Directory environment. The lab focuses on setting up a domain controller, configuring DNS, managing domain users, groups, and organizational units (OUs), and joining Windows client machines to the domain. The purpose of this project is to simulate common enterprise IT administration and help desk tasks in a controlled environment.
